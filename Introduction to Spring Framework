
		Introduction to Spring Framework
	-	Spring is a dependency injection framework.
	-	Avoid tight coupling, EG. having constructors for dependencies;

		//Tight coupling
		public class ComplexBusinessService	 { 
			SortAlgorithm algorithm = new BubbleSortAlgorithm();
		}

		//Decoupled
		public class ComplexBusinessService	 { 
			SortAlgorithm algorithm;

			public ComplexBusinessService(SortAlgorithm sortAlgorithm) {
				this.algorithm = sortAlgorithm;
			}
		}

	-	Use @Component annotation to tell spring to manage instances of a class.
	-	Use @Autowired annotation to tell spring to manage a dependency of a component.

		//Spring
		@Component
		public class ComplexBusinessService	 {
			@Autowired
			SortAlgorithm algorithm;
		}

	-	Instances of components are also known as beans.
