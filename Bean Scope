
		Scope of a bean
	-	Singleton is default scope for beans in Spring.

	-	Singleton - one instance per context.
	-	Prototype - new bean whenever requested.
	-	Request - one bean per http request.
	-	Session - one bean per http session.

	-	Use proxyMode annotation if you need a prototype bean within a singleton bean.

	- 	Spring singleton is different from GOF singleton in that you can have multiple singletons per JVM, one per application context. GOF singleton is one per JVM.
