
		@Component vs @Service vs @Respository vs @Controller
	-	@Component is generic and can be used in any layer (not advised)
	-	@Controller should be used in the web layer.
	-	@Service should be used in the business layer.
	-	@Repository should be used in the data layer.

	There is no functional difference between these annotations however you can configure specific behaviour by annotation.
