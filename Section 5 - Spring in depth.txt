	-	Singleton is default scope for beans in Spring.

	-	Singleton - one instance per context.
	-	Prototype - new bean whenever requested.
	-	Request - one bean per http request.
	-	Session - one bean per http session.

	-	Use proxyMode annotation if you need a prototype bean within a singleton bean.

	- 	Spring singleton is different from GOF singleton in that you can have multiple singletons per JVM, one per application context. GOF singleton is one per JVM.

		@Component vs @Service vs @Respository vs @Controller

	-	@Component is generic and can be used in any layer (not advised)
	-	@Controller should be used in the web layer.
	-	@Service should be used in the business layer.
	-	@Repository should be used in the data layer.

		There is no functional difference between these annotations however you can configure specific behaviour by annotation.

		Autowiring in depth

	-	Use @Primary annotation to disguish which @Component is used when there is ambiguity.
	-	Name of injected field can also be used during ambiguity.
	-	@Primary annotation takes precedence if it and name of field are in conflict.
	-	@Qualifier annotation can also be used to resolve ambiguity.

	-	Use @Primary when you have one implementation that is most widely used.
	-	Use name or qualifier in situations when you are more likely to change implementation.
