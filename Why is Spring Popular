
		Why is Spring so popular?
	-	Produces code that is easy to test, through dependency injection. Also provides good support for JUnit, Mockito and other test frameworks.
	-	No plumbing code for exception handling, xml configuration etc.
	-	Enables flexible architecture due to it's modularity. Only take the parts of Spring you need.
	-	Stays current, new projects such as Spring Cloud and Spring Boot keep spring relevent.
